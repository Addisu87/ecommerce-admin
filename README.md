## About this project

The project is an integrated system designed to function as an Admin Dashboard, serving the roles of Content Management System (CMS), Administration, and API provider. The main features of the project include the ability to manage multiple vendors through a single CMS, perform CRUD operations on billboards, categories, and products, and generate APIs for various use cases. The system also supports CRUD operations for filters (variants) such as Color and Size, enabling a comprehensive management of the available data.
